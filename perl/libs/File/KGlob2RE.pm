# The supported features are (where x is a single character and X and Y are
# strings):
#
# .	matches .
# \x	matches x
# [...]	matches a single character falling into the described character class
# ?	matches any single character except /
# *	matches zero or more characters not including /
# %	matches zero or more directories (see technical notes at bottom)
# {X,Y}	matches either pattern X or Y (can list any number of patterns)
#
#Examples:
# %s.*	    matches any file whose name starts with "s." in any directory
# %*.o	    matches any file whose name ends with ".o" in any directory
# %old/*    matches any file in a directory called "old"
# %new%*    matches any file in a directory called "new" or a subdirectory
#	    of a directory called "new"
# /%*	    matches any absolute path name
# {*,?*%*}  matches any relative path name (this would be very inefficient
#	    except that it is specifically optimized)
# %X  X%*   these are also specifically optimized

#Technical notes:
# 
# Items were listed in order of precedence.  For example:  \[ matches [;  ?, *,
# %, and { have no special meaning within [...];  \x within [...] matches x so
# [\][] matches [ or ];  all, including {X,Y}, can be used within {X,Y}.
#
# % will match / or /.../.  If % is the first character of a pattern, it will
# also match the empty string.  For sanity, /%/, /%, and %/ are equivalent to %
# except that this will not cause % to be considered as the first character in
# a pattern.  So "/%/X" and "/%X" will match "/X" but not "X" (which is good).
#
# Note that {} and % interfere in the following ways:  A % inside {} is never
# considered as being the first character of a pattern, even when it probably
# should be;  If /'s or %'s (but not both) are nested in {} they will not be
# treated as adjacent and so the (possibly redundant) / will not be removed,
# even when it probably should be removed.
#
# Hint:  If you have "/" appended to all directory file names, patterns ending
# in "/" will only match directory names.  A % at the end of a pattern will
# never match unless you do this.
#
# You can use
#	m/$re/[o]
# or
#	eval "m'" . $re . "'"
# But other choices may not work.  For example,
#	eval "m/" . $re . "/"
# won't because I don't bother to quote /'s.  And
#	eval 'm"' . $re . '"'
# risks interpretation of $ in unexpected ways (I think).
